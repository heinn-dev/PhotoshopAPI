# PhotoshopAPI

A few slopped together tweaks to [PhotoshopAPI](https://github.com/EmilDohne/PhotoshopAPI), to get [my Blender add-on](https://github.com/heinn-dev/blender_psd) working
- allows loading and saving Adjustment Layers without data loss, and editing their mask
- exposes layer_id (`lyid` in the psd spec)
